# Space Invaders game using pygame library in python

-simple space invaders game build using pygame library in python 3.9

-all necessary game assets are in the folder

-pygame must be installed to run main.py

# possible errors

the main.py script seems to only run and load assets with the Pycharm IDE, to make it run in other IDEs or code editors, the path of the game assets needs to be changed accordingly after downloading and extracting the zip file
